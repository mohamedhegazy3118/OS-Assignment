1. Code Examples Explanation:

   - Exercise 1 (process_creation.c):
     This program demonstrates process creation using the `fork()` system call.
     `fork()` creates a new process by duplicating the calling process.
     - If `fork()` returns 0, it is the child process.
     - If `fork()` returns a positive integer, it is the parent process (the value is the child's PID).
     - If `fork()` returns -1, the creation failed.
     The program prints different messages depending on whether it is the parent or child.

   - Exercise 2 (exercise2.c):
     Demonstrates starting a process in the background programmatically.
     - The program forks a child process.
     - The parent process exits immediately after printing the child's PID.
     - The child process continues to run (sleeps for 10 seconds) in the background, detached from the parent's immediate execution flow.

   - Exercise 3 (exercise3.c):
     Demonstrates stopping a process using signals.
     - The program forks a child process that sleeps.
     - The parent process uses `kill(pid, SIGKILL)` to send a termination signal to the child process, effectively stopping it.

   - Exercise 4 (exercise4.c):
     Demonstrates pausing and resuming a process using signals.
     - The program forks a child process that prints a message in a loop.
     - The parent uses `kill(pid, SIGSTOP)` to pause the child.
     - After a delay, the parent uses `kill(pid, SIGCONT)` to resume the child's execution.

   - Exercise 5 (file1.c & file2.c):
     Demonstrates the role of the Linker.
     - `file1.c` defines a function `hello()`.
     - `file2.c` declares `hello()` and calls it in `main()`.
     - When compiled together (`gcc file1.c file2.c -o output_program`), the linker resolves the reference to `hello()` in `file2.o` by finding its definition in `file1.o` and combines them into a single executable.

   - Exercise 6 (simple_program.c):
     Demonstrates the role of the Loader and dynamic libraries.
     - `simple_program.c` is a basic C program.
     - `ldd simple_program`: Lists the shared libraries required by the program. The loader is responsible for loading these libraries into memory at runtime.

2. Job of the Linker:
   The linker is a system utility that takes one or more object files (generated by the compiler) and combines them into a single executable file, library, or another object file. Its main tasks include:
   - Symbol Resolution: It associates references to symbols (functions, global variables) in one object file with their definitions in another object file or library.
   - Relocation: It combines code and data sections from multiple input files and adjusts memory addresses so that the code can execute correctly at runtime.

3. Job of the Loader:
   The loader is a component of the operating system responsible for loading programs into memory and preparing them for execution. Its main tasks include:
   - Allocation: Allocating memory space for the program's code, data, and stack.
   - Linking (Dynamic): If the program uses shared libraries, the loader (dynamic linker/loader) resolves references to these libraries at runtime.
   - Loading: Copying the executable file's instructions and data from disk into the allocated memory.
   - Initialization: Setting up registers, the stack, and jumping to the program's entry point (usually `_start`, which calls `main`).
